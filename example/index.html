            A race of humans who possess angel blood, the Nephilim or Shadowhunters, is organized to patrol the Shadow World and prevent demons as well as Downworlders, including warlocks, faeries, werewolves, and vampires, from attacking the mundanes. There is an uneasy peace, a treaty known as The Accords, between the governing body of the Nephilim, known as the Clave, and the Downworlders, not all of whom want peace or respect the Clave's authority. <br>

                <p style = "margin-left: 10px; font-size: 20px;"> The first series within the Shadowhunter Chronicles is the Infernal Devices series. Set in 1878 in Victorian era London, it revolves around Tessa Gray, a teenager who comes to London following her brother's invitation but ends up thrust into the Shadow World upon learning she is not a mundane but, rather, a warlock variant, warlocks being half-human and half-demon. Tessa is unique even among warlocks, as she is the only known case of having Nephilim heritage. The Nephilim, here textually often referred to as Shadowhunters, are blessed with the blood of the angel, thus making Tessa a fourth seraphic.</p>

It is set in 1903 London and Paris and revolves around Tessa's children, James and Lucie, as well as their family friend, Cordelia Carstairs, as they navigate through the politics of the London Enclave.</p>

                <p style = "margin-left: 10px; font-size: 20px;"> Although this is the third series chronologically, it was the first to be published. <em>The Mortal Instruments</em> is mainly set in the year 2007 and revolves around the Shadowhunter Clary Fairchild. She and her friends are confronted with two wars: the first against Valentine Morgenstern, and the second against his son Jonathan Morgenstern.</p>
